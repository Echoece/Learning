# Serialization:
Serialization in Java is a mechanism of writing the state of an object into a byte-stream. It is mainly used in Hibernate, RMI, JPA, EJB and JMS technologies

# Deserialization:
The reverse operation of serialization is called deserialization where byte-stream is converted into an object.

-> The serialization and deserialization process is platform-independent, it means you can serialize an object
   on one platform and deserialize it on a different platform.
-> We must have to implement the Serializable interface for serializing the object.


# java.io.Serializable interface:
Serializable is a marker interface (has no data member and method). It is used to "mark" Java classes so that the objects of these
classes may get a certain capability. The Cloneable and Remote are also marker interfaces.
The String class and all the wrapper classes implement the java.io.Serializable interface by default.
