The static factory methods Collectors.groupingBy() and Collectors.groupingByConcurrent() provide us with functionality
similar to the â€˜GROUP BY' clause in the SQL language. We use them for grouping objects by some property and storing results in a Map instance.

For example, if you have a list of people, how do you organise them by city? Is it better to visit London, Paris, or Tokyo?
