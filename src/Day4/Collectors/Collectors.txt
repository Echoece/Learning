Collectors is a final class that extends Object class. It provides reduction operations, such as accumulating elements into collections,
summarizing elements according to various criteria, etc.


Collectors.collectingAndThen():
CollectingAndThen is a special collector that allows us to perform another action on a result straight after collecting ends.
        List<String> result = givenList.stream().collect(collectingAndThen(toList(), ImmutableList::copyOf))


Collectors.joining():
Joining collector can be used for joining Stream<String> elements. Here the parameters are delimiter, prefix, postfix.
        String result = givenList.stream().collect(joining(" ", "PRE-", "-POST"));
