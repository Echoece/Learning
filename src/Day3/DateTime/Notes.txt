-> In Java date is a long number that contains milliseconds passed since 1st January, 1970
-> Java follows starting year of calender in 1900.

old date API - > Date class from java.util , it  has some property (mutable, contains both date and time, counts
                 milli second) that might be issue. They don't provide thread safety.
                 Example: Java.lang.System, java.util.Date, java.util.Calendar, java.text.SimpleDateFormat, java.util.TimeZone

new Date API -> it is known as joda Date and time API. It has separate class for LocalDate, LocalTIme and LocalDateTime.
                These classes also represent the time since jan 1, 1970. But these classes are immutable. So whenever we change
                we will get a new object of these classes. As a result, they provide thread safety.

#  Temporal Adjusters:
The TemporalAdjusters class provides static methods to obtain useful and common TemporalAdjuster objects, such as:
    -> Finding the first or last day of the month.
    -> Finding the first day of next month.
    -> Finding the first or last day of the year.
    -> Finding the first day of next year.
    -> Finding the first or last "day-of-week" within a month, such as "first Wednesday in June".
    -> Finding the next or previous "day-of-week", such as "next Thursday".
All methods provided by TemporalAdjusters are static and return a TemporalAdjuster object.

# ZoneId:
The ZoneId class is used to identify a time zone and provide the conversion rules between LocalDateTime and Instant.
In terms of offset rules, ZoneId is divided into 2 types:
    1. ZoneId with a fixed time zone offset, such as "UTC+07", "GMT-05:40", "UT-03", "+05:50".
    3. ZoneId with a non-fixed time zone offset, such as "Europe/Paris". Its time zone offset depends on the time on the timeline or depends on the day-of-year.

For example, ZoneId.of("Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh") is the time zone identifier of southern Vietnam. During the period from 1960 to before June 13th, 1975, the time
zone offset of this ZoneId was +8, but later changed to +7 to unify with northern Vietnam.

//----------------------------------------------------------------------
ZoneOffset:
The ZoneOffset class is a subclass of ZoneId. The ZoneOffset class declares three constants:
    MAX: It is the maximum supported zone offsets.
    MIN: It is the minimum supported zone offsets.
    UTC: It is the time zone offset constant for UTC.

//----------------------------------------------------------------------
ZonedDateTime:
ZonedDateTime is a class representing date and time with time zone information, located in the ISO-8601 calendar system, such as
2007-12-03T10:15:30+01:00 Europe/Paris.
With a LocalDateTime object containing only date and time information, we add time zone information to create a
ZonedDateTime object containing date, time, and time zone information.

# New Date Time API in Java 8:
All classes below is in the package java.time.

LocalDate:           It represents a year-month-day in the ISO calendar and is useful for representing a date without a time. It can
                     be used to represent a date only information such as a birth date or wedding date.

LocalTime:           It deals in time only. It is useful for representing human-based time of day, such as movie times, or the opening
                     and closing times of the local library.

LocalDateTime:       It handles both date and time, without a time zone. It is a combination of LocalDate with LocalTime.

ZonedDateTime:       It combines the LocalDateTime class with the zone information given in ZoneId class. It represent a
                     complete date time stamp along with timezone information.

OffsetTime:          It handles time with a corresponding time zone offset from Greenwich/UTC, without a time zone ID.

OffsetDateTime:      It handles a date and time with a corresponding time zone offset from Greenwich/UTC, without a time zone ID.

Clock :              It provides access to the current instant, date and time in any given time-zone. Although the use of the Clock class is
                     optional, this feature allows us to test your code for other time zones, or by using a fixed clock, where time does not change.

Instant :            It represents the start of a nanosecond on the timeline (since EPOCH) and useful for generating a timestamp to represent
                     machine time. An instant that occurs before the epoch has a negative value, and an instant that occurs after the epoch has a positive value.

Duration :           Difference between two instants and measured in seconds or nanoseconds and does not use date-based constructs such as
                     years, months, and days, though the class provides methods that convert to days, hours, and minutes.

Period :             It is used to define the difference between dates in date-based values (years, months, days).

ZoneId :             It states a time zone identifier and provides rules for converting between an Instant and a LocalDateTime.

ZoneOffset :         It describe a time zone offset from Greenwich/UTC time.

DateTimeFormatter :  It comes up with various predefined formatter, or we can define our own. It has parse() or format()
                     method for parsing and formatting the date time values.
