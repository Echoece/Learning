/*
Java ZoneId class specifies a time zone identifier and provides a rule for converting between an Instant and a LocalDateTime.
It inherits Object class and implements the Serializable interface.

There are two sorts of ID:
        -> Fixed offsets are fully resolved offsets from UTC/Greenwich that apply to all local date-times.
        -> Geographical regions are areas where a set of rules for determining the offset from UTC/Greenwich apply.
