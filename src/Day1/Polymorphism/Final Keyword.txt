The final keyword in java is used to restrict the user.

The java final keyword can be used in many context. Final can be:
1. variable: If we make any variable as final, we cannot change/reassign the value of final variable(It will be constant basically).
2. method: If we make any method as final, we cannot override it.
3. class: If you make any class as final, you cannot extend it.
Note: If we dont follow the above rules, we will get compile time error.

-> Child classes can inherit the final methods (but of course they cant override it).
-> A final variable that is not initialized at the time of declaration is known as blank/uninitialized final variable. It
   can only be initialize in constructor. Use case example: For PAN or CARD number of an employee.
-> A static final variable that is not initialized at the time of declaration is known as static blank final variable. It
   can be initialized only in static block.
-> If we declare any parameter of a method as final, we cannot change the value of it inside the method anymore.
-> As constructors are never inherited, we cant declare them as final.
