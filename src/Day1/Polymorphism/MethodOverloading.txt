# Method Overloading:
If a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters, it is known as Method Overloading. We can even
overload the main method if we need.

/------------------------------------------------------------/

# There are two ways to overload the method in java:
    1. By changing number of arguments
    2. By changing the data type of the arguments
    3. By changing the order of parameters in the method.
Also:
    1. the methods can or cant have different return type
    2. can or cant have different access modifier
    3. throw different checked or unchecked exception
In Java, Method Overloading is not possible by changing the return type of the method only. (it will be compile time error if both function is identical).

/------------------------------------------------------------/

# Type promotion in method overloading
One type is promoted to another implicitly (check the image) if no matching datatype is found. For example,
-> byte can be promoted to short, int, long, float or double
-> The short datatype can be promoted to int, long, float or double
-> The char datatype can be promoted to int,long,float or double
-> int datatype can be promoted to float, long double and so on

Note: By default, a datatype will try to go to the method which has the closest bigger matching datatype argument. For example, if we have 3 method with
int, long, float parameters and if we call method with byte data type. In this case, it will go to the next bigger datatype int.

It is possible to have ambiguity in certain cases of type promotion, check the example for details.
