# Method Overriding:
If subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class, it is known as method overriding in Java.
-> Method overriding is used to provide the specific implementation of a method which is already provided by its superclass.
-> Method overriding is used for runtime polymorphism

/------------------------------------------------------------/

# Rules for Java Method Overriding
-> The method must have the same name and parameter as in the parent class
-> return type can be subclass of the return type in parent class
-> There must be an IS-A relationship (inheritance).

-> we cant override static, final method.

-> we can override the access modifier for the methods as well, as long as we give the access modifier more access instead of less.for example,
   we can make a protected method from parent class public.However we cant change private methods access modifier. If we make access modifier
   more restrictive in the child class it will throw compile time error.

In case we want to call parents method that are being overridden in the child class, we can call super.methodName()

/------------------------------------------------------------/

# Why can we not override static method?
It is because the static method is bound with class whereas instance method is bound with an object. Static belongs to the class
area, and an instance belongs to the heap area.

# Can we override java main method?
No, because the main is a static method.
