The super keyword in Java is a reference variable which is used to refer immediate parent class object. Whenever we create
the instance of subclass, an instance of parent class is created implicitly which is referred by super reference variable.

Usage of Java super Keyword
-> super can be used to refer immediate parent class instance variable. Example: super.name
-> super can be used to invoke immediate parent class method. Example: super.foo()
-> super() can be used to invoke immediate parent class constructor.

Note: super() is added in each class constructor automatically by compiler if there is no super() or this().
