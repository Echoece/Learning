 A simple Enum is a list of values that you can only select one from at a time.
 Example, a size can be only one of S, M, L, etc for any given cloth.
 You could use simple constants instead of the Basics.Enum but this has its advantages of readability, easier maintenance and strict type checking.


    Java enums are more powerful than C/C++ enums . In Java, we can also add variables, methods and constructors to it.
    The main objective of enum is to define our own data types(Enumerated Data Types).

    important notes ::
    => Every enum internally implemented by using Enum Class.
    => Every enum constant represents an object of type enum.
    => Every enum constant is always implicitly public static final. Since it is static, we can access it by using enum Name.
       Since it is final, we canâ€™t create child enums.
    => We can declare main() method inside enum. Hence we can invoke enum directly from the Command Prompt.


    -> Enum improves type safety
    -> Enum can be easily used in switch
    -> Enum can be traversed
    -> Enum can have fields, constructors and methods
    -> Enum may implement many interfaces but cannot extend any class because it internally extends Enum class
